      <p>Hello, my name is Clint Buchhauser. I’m a San Diego native and graduate of San Diego State University. Welcome to my
        Portfolio! This is a project that I’m creating for the UCSD Coding Bootcamp. My goal is to become a full stack developer.</p>

      <p>I currently work in hotel marketing, creating both digital and print collateral for a downtown hotel. When I’m not
        working or studying, I enjoy spending time at the beach, playing soccer, and hiking. I like to go on snowboarding
        trips with my friends when there’s snow up north. I also keep tropical fish and frogs as a hobby.</p>

      <p>I look forward to continuing to work on this portfolio as my coding skills improve. Thank you for visiting!</p>
